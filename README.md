All libraries and packages from 'requirements.txt' file

It is recommended to create a virtual environment in which to install the above dependencies.

## Installation and Running
To generate the dashboard UI that produces the model results using the command line:

1. From command line, go to the directory of the project folder (called <code>):

    cd <path>/code


2. Activate the virtual environment:

  source <environment_name>/bin/activate

Here <environment_name> = myenv

3. Install the required libraries and packages from requirements.txt file using PIP (must install if you do not have):

  pip install -r requirements. txt


4. Run the code: 

  <environment_name>/bin/python3.11 "src/main.py"
